# Policy documents for the Dogecoin Foundation

This repository contains policy documents produced by the Dogecoin Foundation, 
for use by the Foundation and the Dogecoin Community in the interest of 
maintaining transparent operations and good conduct within the Dogecoin 
Ecosystem.


## Change / tracking

From time to time, as determined by the Board and/or delegated Policy Working 
Group, these policies may change or be added to. Specifically, Git has been 
chosen to make any changes to policy transparent, allowing for changes to 
be tracked through commit history.

## Format

Unless for some very specific exceptions, ie: [Code of Shibes](policy_02_conduct.md) where
clarity and brevity requires alternate formatting, all policy documents should 
follow a simple format:

```md
# Title

## Purpose

## Scope

< policy details >
```

## Essence

Policies should be aligned with the essence of the [Dogecoin Manifesto](policy_01_manifesto.md)
and should be easily explained through the lense of it's four pillars. Policies that 
directly contradict the Manifesto should be early-warning signs of organisational drift
and cause for concern. Anyone in the community should feel free to request clarification 
on policy that strongly contradicts the essence of the Manifesto.
