# Dogecoin Manifesto

## Purpose

The Dogecoin Manifesto was established to define the core values of the Dogecoin
developer community, and to set a north-star for policy making and technical 
decision and prioritisation. 

It is believed that by _honestly and in good faith_ aligning future decisions both 
technical and social to these core values, Dogecoin can remain true to itself and 
to its purpose as a fun and simple currency for all of humanity.

## Scope

The Manifesto is provided to meet the above purpose for all Shibes contributing
in any way to the Dogecoin community and ecosystem. You should feel empowered to
use the four pillars of the manifesto to guide you as you build, champion, represent
and communicate Dogecoin with the world. Do Only Good Everyday!

## Manifesto Text

We are Dogecoin, the accidental crypto-movement that makes people smile.

We are developing a currency for the people,</br>
and we strive to do only good everyday.</br>
Through this work we have come to value:</br>

Being **useful**, we value _utility_ over _technical brilliance_.</br>
Being **personable**, we value _individuals and interactions_ over _profit-driven economics_.</br>
Being **welcoming**, we value _collaboration and trust_ over _competition and exclusivity_.</br>
Being **reliable**, we value _working solutions_ over _speed of delivery_.</br>

That is, while there is value in the items on</br>
the right, we value the items on the left more.

Signatories,

– Billy Markus</br>

Development practices the world over.
